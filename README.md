# [JavaScript for Windows 10 Universal Apps][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Native applications have long been the realm of compiled languages, such as C and its cousins. But Microsoft wants to get web developers in on desktop app development, and to allow them to write native applications that run on all flavors of Windows 10 (PC, tablet, phone, and XBox).

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you how to program universal Windows 10 apps using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. You'll learn how to set up the development environment and how to use the WinJS library for accessing native functionality. Eventually, you'll go on to build a full-featured app that can run on any Windows device!
